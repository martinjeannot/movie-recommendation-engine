A simple movie recommendation engine

**Demo live** : https://my-movie-recommendation-engine.herokuapp.com/index.html


I've recently been exposed to Gaussian Mixture models (GMM) as well as the Expectation Maximization algorithm in the context of GMM. I looked into simple applications of these and movie recommendations came up a lot, hence this project.

The dataset used is the small MovieLens dataset , it contains 100 000 ratings applied to 9 000 movies by 600 users.

The model used in the demo has been trained with K=20 (number of gaussian components) and ultimately achieved a log-likelihood of about -122802.15.
